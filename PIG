2 a) Which part of the US has the most Data Engineer jobs for each year?
   b) find top 5 locations in the US who have got certified visa for each year.

2 a)bag1 = load '/user/hive/warehouse/h1bapplication.db/h1b_final' using PigStorage() as (s_no:int,case_status:chararray,employer_name:chararray,soc_name:chararray,job_title:chararray,full_time_position:chararray,prevailing_wage:int,year:int,worksite:chararray,long:double,lati:double);
bag2 = filter bag1 by ($4 MATCHES '.*DATA ENGINEER.*');
bag3 = group bag2 by (year,worksite);
bag4 = foreach bag3 generate group,COUNT(bag2) as total;
bag5 = foreach bag4 generate FLATTEN(group),total;
bag6 = group bag5 by year;
top = foreach bag6 {
sorted = order bag5 by total desc;
top1 = limit sorted 1;
generate flatten(top1);
};
dump top;
2 b)
bag1 = load '/user/hive/warehouse/h1bapplication.db/h1b_final' using PigStorage() as (s_no:int,case_status:chararray,employer_name:chararray,soc_name:chararray,job_title:chararray,full_time_position:chararray,prevailing_wage:int,year:int,worksite:chararray,long:double,lati:double);
bag2 = filter bag1 by ($1 MATCHES 'CERTIFIED');
bag3 = group bag2 by (year,worksite);
bag4 = foreach bag3 generate group,COUNT(bag2) as total;
bag5 = foreach bag4 generate FLATTEN(group),total;
bag6 = group bag5 by year;
bag7 = foreach bag6
{
sorted = order bag5 by total desc;
top5 = limit sorted 5;
generate FLATTEN(top5);
}
dump bag7;

4)Which top 5 employers file the most petitions each year? - Case Status - ALL


bag1 = load '/user/hive/warehouse/h1bapplication.db/h1b_final' using PigStorage() as (s_no:int,case_status:chararray,employer_name:chararray,soc_name:chararray,job_title:chararray,full_time_position:chararray,prevailing_wage:int,year:int,worksite:chararray,long:double,lati:double);
bag2 = group bag1 by (employer_name,year);
bag4= foreach bag2 generate flatten(group),COUNT(bag1);

split bag4 into bag5 if year ==2011,bag6 if year ==2012,bag7 if year ==2013,bag8 if year ==2014,bag9 if year ==2015,bag10 if year ==2016;
bag11 = order bag5 by $2 desc;
bag12 = limit bag11 5;
bag13 = order bag6 by $2 desc;
bag14 = limit bag13 5;
bag15 = order bag7 by $2 desc;
bag16 = limit bag15 5;
bag17 = order bag8 by $2 desc;
bag18 = limit bag17 5;

6) Find the percentage and the count of each case status on total applications for each year.

bag1 = load '/user/hive/warehouse/h1bapplication.db/h1b_final' using PigStorage() as (s_no:int,case_status:chararray,employer_name:chararray,soc_name:chararray,job_title:chararray,full_time_position:chararray,prevailing_wage:int,year:int,worksite:chararray,long:double,lati:double);
bag2 = group bag1 by year ; 
bag4 = foreach bag2 generate group as year,bag1.case_status;
bag5 = foreach bag4 generate year,FLATTEN($1);
split bag5 into bag6  if null::case_status =='CERTIFIED-WITHDRAWN',bag7 if null::case_status =='WITHDRAWN' ,bag8 if null::case_status =='CERTIFIED',bag9 if null::case_status =='DENIED';  
bag10 = group bag6 by year ;   
bag11 = group bag7 by year ;  
bag12 = group bag8 by year;  
bag13 = group bag9 by year; 
bag14 = foreach bag10 generate group as year,COUNT(bag6.$1); 
bag15 = foreach bag11 generate group as year,COUNT(bag7.$1); 
bag16 = foreach bag12 generate group as year,COUNT(bag8.$1); 
bag17 = foreach bag13 generate group as year,COUNT(bag9.$1);
bag18 =join bag14 by $0,bag15 by $0,bag16 by $0,bag17 by $0;
optimised = foreach bag18 generate $0,$1,$3,$5,$7,$1+$3+$5+$7;
dump optimised;
bag20 = foreach optimised generate $0,((double)$1/$5*100),((double)$2/$5*100),((double)$3/$5*100),((double)$4/$5*100);
dump bag20;

bag19 = order bag9 by $2 desc;
bag20 = limit bag19 5;
bag21 = order bag10 by $2 desc;
bag22 = limit bag21 5;
unionism = union bag12,bag14,bag16,bag18,bag20,bag22;
dump unionism;
